		<h3>Making a classifier for financial data</h3>

		<p>
			Recently I’ve been looking into the stock market on how to make money, and have stumbled upon a tool in the technical analysis of stocks called Bollinger Bands. I’ll explain a little bit about that below, but you can also learn more about them here: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp"> More Information About Bollinger Bands </a>. Likewise, I’ll also give a brief rundown of stocks, but you may want to read this link for a more in depth treatment of the subject: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/stocks1.asp"> More Information About Stocks </a>. 

			This project aims to use basic techniques of machine learning to predict the future prices of various stocks. The specific algorithm I aim to use for this project is ‘logistic regression’, an algorithm most commonly used for classification. The classification in this specific case will be whether the a stock price will go up the day after the given date for a particular example. The features of this task will be the the values of each band in the ‘bollinger band’ technique (using a window of 20 days), on the day that the example was recorded. Python will be the designated language for this project.
		</p>

		<h3>Stocks</h3>

		<p>
		In the most abstract terms needed to build this project, a stock is like a purchasable company item that’s price can fluctuate in ways somewhat corresponding to a company's success.
		</p>

		<h3>Bollinger Bands</h3>
		<p>
			To give a brief description of what Bollinger Bands are, I’ll say that they are a tool used in the technical analysis of stocks. The bands help investors determine the state of the market in relation to the price history and depending on the how the bands are positioned, some investors can make more informed decisions about their purchases. The ‘bands’ can be thought of as lines on a graph of a stock price’s history. Usually you have an ‘upper band’ that represents a line that is 2 standard deviations above the average line for some given window of time. The ‘lower band’ is the opposite of that. It’s a line 2 standard deviations below the average price of the window. Usually investors can use where the position of the real stock price history in relation to these 3 bands to do their technical analysis with.
		<p>


		<h3>Project Implementation</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>
		The first thing we need to do for any ML project after determining the task, is find a viable dataset for the algorithm to learn from. This can be done by downloading a year’s worth of stock data from various stocks. To download historical data about a company's stock price, visit: "http://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=[COMPANY_TICKER_SYMBOL]&output=csv" replacing the substring [COMPANY_TICKER_SYMBOL] with the ticker symbol of the desired company. For example, a link to Nvidia stock informatio would be written as: <a href="http://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=NVDA&output=csv"> http://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=NVDA&output=csv</a>
		</li>

		<li>
		Next, we’re going read the data in and put it into a format our classifier can use. In this project, the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn library</a> will be used. Sci-kit learn can be <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip installed</a> from the command line. It takes an array containing examples for the algorithm to learn from, and another array with the classification we want the algorithm to return. I'll be using the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas library</a> to format the data.
		</li>

		<li>
		Scikit learn makes it extremely easy for us to run our algorithm, and the training for the classification algorithm can be run in less than 10 lines!
		Now that we have our model, we would like to evaluate it on our ‘test’ set
		</li>

		<li>
		Evaluate the test set, and try using different features in an attempt to optimize performance!
		There you have it, you’ve just built a classifier for financial data!
		</li>
